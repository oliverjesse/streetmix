== About StreetMix

StreetMix is a real-time collaborative mobile social detective game.  I designed it with fellow UC-Berkeley student L. Scotty Hoag for Greg Niemeyer and Jim Holston's mobile urban anthropology seminar in Spring 2010.

Scotty wrote the android app, which is available here: http://github.com/oliverjesse/streetmix-android.  I'm at work on an iPhone app.

This repository is mostly open sourced to show potential employers a little sample code I've written.  Note the specs.

For the intrepid, you can see the worst code in the project at https://github.com/oliverjesse/streetmix/blob/master/app/models/team.rb, which contains
an implementation of a perimeter walk algorithm for finding the maximum area that can be enclosed by an arbitrary set of points on a plane.  I translated it from Java under deadline in about two hours.

== How the Game Works

The idea is that two or more teams compete to take photos and assemble a narrative connecting "clues" that help solve a mystery.  Most of the scenarios we wrote were heavily open-ended and in live playtesting, we scored the game such that the goal was to create an interesting story more than to solve the puzzle correctly.

To play, you'll need to assemble two or more people with the mobile clients installed on their Android phones.  When you're ready, click "go" on the website and then run around with the smart phones snapping photos of any clues you find.  By means of a basic RESTful API for the mobile devices, found clues will appear along with their photographs on this website.

Good luck!

== Scoring

When we playtested the game, we awarded equal points for the greatest area covered, the total number of photos submitted, and the most creative story linking the photos together.  Judges could eliminate any photo that wasn't a part of the story, which each team told in person at the end of the game.

Eventually we might code the scoring flow as part of the website, but so far, we've done it by hand.
