    <p><b>Welcome to Street Jockey!</b></p>

    <p>

      You are part of a team of an experimental team of innovative realtime urban anthropologists.  Your mission is to develop a compelling explanation of a social mystery within a tight time limit.  To do this, youâ€™ll document and use nearby evidence so as to create your explanation.  You can document your evidence using any phone that sends MMS messages, although for best results we recommend a Google Android phone running our neat Street Jockey app!</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Choose a scenario from the list below.
      <li>Gather two or more teams at the starting address.
      <li>Set up each team with an equal number of phones for recording evidence.
      <li>Click "Start Game" and Go!
    </ol>

    <p>

    Your team must be back at mission control within the time limit so as to report your results and compare your explanation with that of the opposing team.
    </p>

    <p>
    <b>Scoring.</b> Teams will earn one point for having the greatest number of pieces of evidence, one for covering the most ground with your evidence, and one for the most creative or brilliant narrative linking the evidence together.  Only evidence that contributes to the overall story will receive points.
